## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   Combines the movie's `genres`, `keywords`, and `overview` into one text field.

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
   Converts the combined text into numerical vectors (removes common stopwords like "the", "and", etc).

3. **Cosine Similarity**  
   Measures how similar one movie is to another based on their vectorized text data.

4. **Streamlit Interface**  
   Lets users select a movie and view 5 similar movie recommendations with their overviews.
